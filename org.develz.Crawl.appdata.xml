    <p>
      Crawl is a fun game in the grand tradition of similar games like Rogue,
      Hack and Moria. The objective is to travel deep into a subterranean cave
      complex and retrieve the Orb of Zot, guarded by many horrible and hideous
      creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have never played Crawl (or a similar game) before, select the
      tutorial from the starting menu. The tutorial explains the interface in
      five easy lessons. Once you're familiar with the controls, you may want to
      play a few games using hints mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the Stone Soup version of Dungeon Crawl.

        <p>
          We are pleased to announce the release of Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup 0.29 “Shooting Stars”!
        </p>
        <p>
          DCSS 0.29 features a sweeping rework of Necromancy, streamlining and upgrading many of its spells, 
          along with similar improvements to the necromantic god Kikubaaqudgha. 
          Ranged weapons have likewise been streamlined and reworked to be more satisfying to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those seeking a special challenge, we’ve also added a new Meteoran species that heals when 
          seeing new terrain and has great skills and attributes. However, Meteorans have to move fast, 
          with only one-tenth the normal time per floor before they suffer heavy draining.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many backgrounds now start with extra scrolls, potions, or other consumables, allowing more tactical 
          options when faced with a sticky situation. Speaking of sticky situations, characters cast into 
          the Abyss will find that monsters there once again give experience and piety, and an ultra-dangerous 
          ‘deep abyss’ is now accessible…
        </p>
        <p>
          Many new item types have been added, like scrolls of poison and wands of quicksilver. 
          Some of these ‘alternate’, with only one type of item from a set being generated in any given game. 
          We’ve also added many exciting new unique monsters, from Amaemon the Diabolical Poisoner to the alt-timeline 
          troll Parghit the Mighty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Launchers, long blades and short blades all now use dexterity instead of strength when calculating damage,
          allowing new evasive playstyles. Monsters no longer gain and lose ‘random energy’, and can instead
          launch opportunistic attacks on fleeing players. As always, there are many more changes small and large alike!
        </p>

    <release version="0.28.0" date="2022-02-04">
      <description>
        <p>
          We are pleased to announce the release of Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup 0.28
          “The Rise and Fall of Ignis Zotdust and the Spiders from Hell”!
        </p>
        <p>
          DCSS 0.28 features a new Cinder Acolyte zealot background that begins
          the game worshiping a new god, Ignis, the Dying Flame. Cinder Acolytes
          start with the new Scorch spell, a -1 flaming branded weapon of choice,
          and five stars of piety. Ignis worshipers cannot gain piety, losing it
          only when using Ignis’ abilities. The abilities are Fiery Armour, which
          grants AC and retaliation flame damage, Foxfire Swarm, which summons
          many foxfires, and Rising Flame, a one-time ability sends the player one
          level above. Once all piety is spent, players will typically abandon for
          another god, and Ignis dies forever when wrath is over.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hell branches have been revised to offer substantially more
          challenge. Each branch features a distinct and persistent negative
          effects that applies while in the branch along with timed effects common
          to all Hells. The branches all have revised monster set with many new
          monsters and smaller layouts for the first six levels, each of which has
          only one downward staircase. The Spider branch has likewise been
          retooled with a roster of new creepy-crawlies, new and revised end maps,
          and updates to the existing layouts and vaults.
        </p>
        <p>
          A new magical orb item type exists for the shield slot. Each orb type
          grants an ego with a powerful passive effect, such as a 3-radius halo
          or a reduction of monster willpower at the expense of your own. The
          god Yredelemnul has been completely redesigned, granting passive
          reaping and accepting the reaped zombies as payment for its dark
          abilities. Okawaru and Jiyva have also seen significant, though not
          quite as sweeping, changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A batch of new spells have been added, As always, there are dozens of
          new deadly vaults, and many more changes small and large alike!

          We are pleased to announce the release of Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup
          0.27 “The Cursed Flame”!
        </p>
        <p>
          DCSS 0.27 features a new Djinni species that cast spells using HP, can
          only learn new spells at random as they level up, and only use the
          spellcasting skill to train magic. We’ve redesigned Ashenzari, who now
          offers curses for your gear to gain piety and skill levels, at the
          cost of destroying the item when the curse is removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A batch of new spells have been added, including Manifold Assault,
          which attacks multiple foes at once with your melee, Storm Form, which
          transforms you into a tempest with electrified, cleaving melee and the
          ability to hurl yourself as lightning at foes, and Animate Armour,
          which draws out the spirit of your armor to fight by your side. Polar
          Vortex is a more damaging, ice-themed replacement for Tornado.
          Maxwell’s Capacitive Coupling is a level 8 air-themed replacement for
          Absolute Zero that vaporizes a nearby monster after a delay. Chain
          Lightning has been reworked into a more powerful level 9 spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spell books have many new types and generate more often, but contain
          fewer spells. We’ve re-balanced branch monster sets and end maps, as
          well as made new end maps for Lair, Shoals, and Snake. As always,
          there are dozens of new deadly vaults, and many more changes small and
          large alike!

        <p>Major bugfixes and updates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dith shadow mimic of launcher attacks no longer copies the enchant and ego of the launcher.</li>
          <li>Monsters lose constriction by Borgnjor's Vile Clutch when they are moved by any means.</li>
          <li>Formicids can now manually cancel Dig status, allowing them to use Wu Jian's Wall Jump ability after digging.</li>
          <li>Wu Jian's Wall Jump ability now works under silence.</li>
          <li>New splash screen art by froggy.</li>
          <li>Numlock on Windows systems no longer causes unpredictable repeating movement.</li>
          <li>Alt-F4 no longer causes freezing in Tiles on Windows systems.</li>
          <li>Resizing the local Tiles window during prompts no longer causes crashes.</li>
          <li>SDL 2 contrib updated to 2.0.7, which fixes compilation under Msys2.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Dith shadow mimics of launcher attacks were giving you all free
          enchantment and ego damage. That's simply unfair to those poor
          dungeon monsters, so we had to fix it! The numlock key causing
          repeating movement was reported by users far and wide, so many thanks
          to advil for tracking down and fixing that rather difficult bug.
          Hopefully you enjoy the new splash art by South Korean artist froggy,
          whose inspirational depiction of Boris and Natasha is a personal
          favorite.
